\section*{Abstract}

  The theme of the project is to explore the possibilities of using neural networks for
  image editing. The main goal was to create tools based on
  trained neural networks used for proper processing and modifying of
  images. Then the effectiveness of these tools was evaluated and
  compared with solutions based on classic image processing methods.

  Two approaches were investigated, automatic coloring of black and white images
  and applying simple filters on images such as Sobel-Feldman filter detecting edges.

  To make the research easier, an original framework, named TorchFrame, has been developed.
  It has the task of controlling
  data flow in the process of teaching and testing the examined models, and hence,
  reduce the need for user interference, while ensuring freedom
  in conducted experiments and implemented data modifications.

  For simple image filters, solutions based on convolutional neural networks proved to
  be slower and more labor-intensive in implementation than classical methods,
  while presenting comparable results.
  However, thanks to them it was possible to prove the enormous universality
  of convolutional neural networks, which can be used in issues related to
  simple image processing. Furthermore, the similarity between traditional filtration
  methods and the way, how the neurons in convolutional networks works, has been shown.
