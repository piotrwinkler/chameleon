\section*{Abstract}
  The theme of the project is to explore the possibilities of using neural networks to
  image editing. The main goal was to create tools based on
  trained neural networks used for appropriate processing and modifying of
  images. Then the effectiveness of these tools was evaluated and
  compared with solutions based on classic image processing methods.

  Two approaches were investigated, automatic coloring of black and white images
  and applying simple filters on images such as Sobel-Feldman filter detecting edges.
